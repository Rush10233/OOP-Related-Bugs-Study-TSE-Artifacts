/* We used to treat a call to a constexpr function as noexcept if
    	     the call was a constant expression (CWG 1129).  This has changed
    	     in P0003 whereby noexcept has no special rule for constant
    	     expressions anymore.  Since the current behavior is important for
    	     certain library functionality, we treat this as a DR, therefore
    	     adjusting the behavior for C++11 and C++14.  Previously, we had
    	     to evaluate the noexcept-specifier's operand here, but that could
    	     cause instantiations that would fail.  */
